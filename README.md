## Git Basics
While doing this section, I've passed Udacity course about Git. I have already knew basic Git commands, however, some of the commands at the end of the course where new for me.

I have also practiced with Git commands on [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/). The first part of training wasn't hard because it was pretty familiar for me, but working with remote repositories was new and a bit challenging.

I've also created my local repository kottans-frontend and added README.md file. Making new repository wasn't hard for me, because I've done this several times before. But I've practiced more with formating README.md files.

The most challenging part was working with Kottans/mock-repo repository, because I've never been working with remote repositories, which require Pull requests etc. However, I've completed this task, and it was a completely new and useful experience for me. =)

## Linux CLI and Networking
I had little experience with Linux as well as with Linux Command Line, so course, where I could practise Linux commands was very useful for me. I was only completely familiar with commands from Module 1, but everything else was completely new. Screenshot with my course success is below or it can also be found inside *task_linux_cli* folder.

I was already familiar with HTTP basics and even had some practise in creating Java RESTful-web-services, but those articles have expanded my understanding of how HTTP actually works and from which parts it consists.

## Git Collaboration

I've accomplished both Qwiklabs Assignments, and this gave me deeper understanding of working with remote repositories and I will definitely use new knowledge in practise.\
**Week 3 Assignment:** [Introduction to Github](https://github.com/SofiiaTrokhymchuk/Intro-to-Github)\
**Week 4 Assignment:** [Pushing Local Commits to Github](https://github.com/SofiiaTrokhymchuk/it-cert-automation-practice)

I've also decided to finish all the tasks on [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) and I've discovered  new Git commands for myself (for instance, *git cherry-pick*) and I'm pretty sure I 'll use them while working with Git as well, because they make life much easier.

I've also checked some additional resources on YouTube so I may assume that now I'm much more confident in using Git.
