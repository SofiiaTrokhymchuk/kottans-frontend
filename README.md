While doing this section, I've passed Udacity course about Git:

I have already knew basic Git commands, however, some of the commands at the end of the course where new for me.\
\
I have also practiced with Git commands on [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/):

The first part of training wasn't hard because it was pretty familiar for me, but working with remote repositories was new and a bit challenging.\
\
I've created my local repository kottans-frontend and added README.md file. Making new repository wasn't hard for me, because I've done this several times before. But I've practiced more with formating README.md files.\
\
The most challenging part was working with Kottans/mock-repo repository, because I've never been working with remote repositories, which require Pull requests etc. However, I've completed this task, and it was a completely new and useful experience for me. =)
