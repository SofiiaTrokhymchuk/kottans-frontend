## Git Basics
While doing this section, I've passed Udacity course about Git. I have already knew basic Git commands, however, some of the commands at the end of the course where new for me.

</details>

I have also practiced with Git commands on [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/). The first part of training wasn't hard because it was pretty familiar for me, but working with remote repositories was new and a bit challenging.

I've also created my local repository kottans-frontend and added README.md file. Making new repository wasn't hard for me, because I've done this several times before. But I've practiced more with formating README.md files.

The most challenging part was working with Kottans/mock-repo repository, because I've never been working with remote repositories, which require Pull requests etc. However, I've completed this task, and it was a completely new and useful experience for me. =)

## Linux CLI and Networking
I had little experience with Linux as well as with Linux Command Line, so course, where I could practise Linux commands was very useful for me. I was only completely familiar with commands from Module 1, but everything else was completely new. Screenshot with my course success is below or it can also be found inside *task_linux_cli* folder.

I was already familiar with HTTP basics and even had some practise in creating Java RESTful-web-services, but those articles have expanded my understanding of how HTTP actually works and from which parts it consists.

## Git Collaboration

I've accomplished both Qwiklabs Assignments, and this gave me deeper understanding of working with remote repositories and I will definitely use new knowledge in practise.

I've also decided to finish all the tasks on [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) and I've discovered  new Git commands for myself (for instance, *git cherry-pick*) and I'm pretty sure I 'll use them while working with Git as well, because they make life much easier.

I've also checked some additional resources on YouTube so I may assume that now I'm much more confident in using Git.

## Intro to HTML and CSS
Course on Coursera was pretty dull at the beginning but much more interesting at the and because I haven't used Bootstrap before. Even though I've already been familiar with the material, the presentation of information was fast and I liked it.

Codecademy wasn't interesting enough as well. I think if I was new to HTML and CSS I would definitely 100% like it. But extra practice is always useful.

Overall, passing through this module was kind of tedious because I was already familiar with HTML and CSS so, practically, I haven't learned anything new. *But!!!* I've actually pointed out some nuances which I didn't know that well. So, basically, it wasn't that mush useless.

## Responsive Web Design
This module was extremely interesting for me. First of all,  I'm curious about responsive web-design and different structure types of layouts (*Flexbox and Grid Layout*). Second of all, I like frogs :frog::green_heart:, and I had the oportunity to play with them on [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/#uk).

The first article of this module was interesting, however, I've been already familiar, for instance, with *@media query* and other things, which were mentioned there.

Even though I've already knew a little bit about **Flexbox**, it was super interesting for me to learn new properties and play with code on [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/#uk) and by my own.

Learning about **Grid** was a bit complicated, because I haven't heard about this layout type before, and Grid is 2-dimentional. Despite this fact, it was still interesting and easy to learn. I think that Grid is the best way to make interesting layouts with images of different sizes (something like collages). And I also had a lot of while olaying with Grid on [Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/).

To sum up, I've learned a lot of new stuff, which I'll definitely use in the future.

## HTML CSS Popup
It was a really cool experience for me to practice my HTML and CSS skills in making Hooli Style Pop-Up. I've gained useful practice in making layouts and responsive Web Desing as well.
You can check the result of my work on [GitHub Pages](https://sofiiatrokhymchuk.github.io/hooli-style-pop-up/) and review my [Code Base](https://github.com/SofiiaTrokhymchuk/hooli-style-pop-up). I really hope you like it!

## JS Basics
Learning JS was super fun for me. JS Basics was a little bit dull. However, I really liked Basic Algorithm Scripting, Functional Programming and Intermediate Algorithm Scripting because I like solving different problems. I knew some JS Basics before, but passing through this module made me more fluent in *coding on JavaScript*. This reminded me of classical meme phrase "Is your native language JavaScript, (~~swear word~~)?" =D.

Anyway, you can checkout my JS progress here:

To sum up, I've learned how to code on JS like a normal person.
